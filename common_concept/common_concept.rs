    // Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack rather than the heap (we will discuss the stack

    // However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to chang

    // Functions with Return Values
    // Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We donâ€™t name return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow (->)
    // There are no function calls, macros, or even let statements in the five functionâ€”just the number 5 by itself. Thatâ€™s a perfectly valid function in Rust. Note that the functionâ€™s return type is specified too, as -> i3

    }

    // Handling Multiple Conditions with else if
    let number = 6;

    // Using too many else if expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to
    // refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called match for these cases.

    // Using if in a let Statement
    // Because if is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a let statement to assign the outcome to a variable, as in Listing 3-2.
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is {number}");

    // Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and numbers by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value of the whole if expression depends on which block of code executes. This means the values that have the potential to be results from each arm of the if must be the same type; in Listing 3-2, the results of both the if arm and the else arm were i32 integers
    // uncomment this code will produce error
    // let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
    // println!("The value of number is: {number}");

    // Repetition with Loops
    // Rust has three kinds of loops: loop, while, and for. Letâ€™s try each one.

    // Repeating Code with loop
    //The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.
    // this will produce infinie loop

    // loop {
    //     println!("again")
    // }

    // Returning Values from Loops
    let mut counter = 0;
    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };
    println!("The result is {result}");

    // Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops
    // If you have loops within loops, break and continue apply to the innermost loop at that point. You can optionally specify a loop label on a loop that we can then use with break or continue to specify that those keywords apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must begin with a single quote. Hereâ€™s an example with two nested loops:

    // The outer loop has the label 'counting_up, and it will count up from 0 to 2. The inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first break that doesnâ€™t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. The break 'counting_up; statement will exit the outer loop.
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");

            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }

            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }

            remaining -= 1;
        }
        count += 1;
    }

    println!("End count = {count}");

    // Conditional Loops with while
    let mut number = 3;
    while number != 0 {
        println!("{number}!");
        number -= 1;
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");

    // Looping Through a Collection with for
    // You can choose to use the while construct to loop over the elements of a collection, such as an array
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }

    // However, this approach is error prone; we could cause the program to panic if the index value or test condition are incorrect. For example, if you changed the definition of the a array to have four elements but forgot to update the condition to while index < 4, the code would panic. Itâ€™s also slow, because the compiler adds runtime code to perform the conditional check of whether the index is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.

    // As a more concise alternative, you can use a for loop and execute some code for each item in a collection

    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is {element}")
    }

    // reverse number
    for number in (1..4).rev() {
        println!("{number}!");
    }
    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");

    // for loop index
    let list: &[i32] = &vec![1, 3, 4, 17, 81];

    for (i, el) in list.iter().enumerate() {
        println!("The current element is {}", el);
        println!("The current index is {}", i);
    }
}

// Note that we defined another_function after the main function in the source code; we could have defined it before as well. Rust doesnâ€™t care where you define your functions, only that theyâ€™re defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller
fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("Value of x : {x}");
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}");
}
